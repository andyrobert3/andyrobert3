### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

Thanks for stopping by! 

I'm Matthew, a Web3 developer based in Singapore, primarily focused on EVM-based development. Currently, I'm expanding my expertise by diving into Solana (SVM) and Rust, aiming to reach a proficient level in both.

I've had the privilege of participating in and winning prizes at several hackathons:
- [Uniswap Hook Incubator](https://projects.atrium.academy/Memediction-1035f0444abe81febee1cdec4580782f) - **Memediction**, AMM Prediction Market built on Uniswap v4 Hooks
- [ETH Brussels 2024](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/launchfi-o5iiq) - **LaunchFi**, a platform for launching custom bonding curve tokens powered by Uniswap & Pancakeswap v4
- [ETH Istanbul 2023](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/cross-chain-safe-f5w5g) - Cross Chain Safe Wallet powered by Hyperlane
- [ETH Tokyo 2023](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/interest-carry-trade-arbitrageur-4scrx) -  Carry swap bot exploits interest rate differentials between lending / borrowing order pairs
- [ETH Taipei 2025](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/qwallet-protocol-esqej) - Decentralized p2p off-ramp service using wise.com with ZK-proofs, utilizing Open Intents Framework


Besides hackathons, these are some open source projects that I contributed towards:
- [Aave v3 Wallet Migration](https://github.com/SBIP-Migration/contracts) - Migrate Aave positions between wallets using Flash Loans
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pulls?q=is:pr+author:andyrobert3+is:closed) 
- [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/pulls?q=is:pr+author:andyrobert3+is:closed)
- [Go Quorum](https://github.com/Consensys/quorum/pulls/matthew-alexander-partior) - go-ethereum permissioned fork by Consensys

Building [IBFT Rust](https://github.com/andyrobert3/ibft-rust) in my spare time, implementation of the PoA Istanbul BFT consensus algorithm in Rust (WIP). 
Contributions welcome :)
